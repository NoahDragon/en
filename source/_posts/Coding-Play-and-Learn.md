I have been planing to come up a list of games that teach people to program. Luckily with the chance got requested to answer on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-good-way-to-learn-how-to-code-very-easily), I spent some time to organize the list.

Here are several sites that allow you to using coding to play.

[CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/) is an RPG game which you could use Javascript, Coffeescript, Lua, Python, Clojure, and Io.

[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/start) I haven’t played it yet, but it looks fun.

[Screeps](https://screeps.com/) is an online RTS. You have to build up your territory, and defend it from AI and other player’s attach. For now, it only support the Javascript, and you have to pay2play.

[FightCode](http://fightcodegame.com/) Build your smart tank and beat others. It’s really similar to [Robocode](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/).

[Elevator Saga](http://play.elevatorsaga.com/) You become an elevator operator. You have to deliver certain number of people within a time frame to pass to next level.

[Battle Code](https://www.battlecode.org/) Not know much about it, but it holds contest for students.

[Ruby Warrior](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior/#/warriors) Learn Ruby and beat dungeon.

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) Visually coding.

[LightBot](https://lightbot.com/) Simple game which teachs the basic function and loop concepts.

Although these games could not lead you to create applications, they are good start up. If you found you really enjoy the game, you could pick a programming language to learn it deeper.
