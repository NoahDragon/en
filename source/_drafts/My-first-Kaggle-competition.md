I joined the [Kaggle TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge) two month ago. I should say I was attracted by the money rewards, but turns out I was learned more than I expected.

<!-- more -->

Here is a little background about myself: master degree on NLP area, researching on speech recognition on start-up project, haven't attend any online copetition before. So when I first saw this Kaggle challenge, it just fits my NLP background and start-up project needs. So I'm not totally fresh for machine learning and data analysis, but still learned a lot throught this competition.
